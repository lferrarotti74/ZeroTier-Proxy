## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:
- **Docker** (version 20.10 or later)
- **Git** for version control
- **Basic understanding** of ZeroTier TCP Proxy functionality
- **Text editor** or IDE of your choice

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lferrarotti74/ZeroTier-Proxy.git
   cd ZeroTier-Proxy
   ```

2. **Build the Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t zerotier-proxy:dev .
   ```

3. **Test the Build**:
   ```bash
   # Run the proxy server
   docker run -d --name test-proxy -p 443:443 zerotier-proxy:dev
   
   # Check if it's running
   docker logs test-proxy
   
   # Clean up
   docker stop test-proxy && docker rm test-proxy
   ```

### Local Development Setup

For development and testing:

1. **Create a test environment**:
   ```bash
   # Create a development network
   docker network create zerotier-dev
   
   # Run proxy in development mode
   docker run -d --name zerotier-proxy-dev \
     --network zerotier-dev \
     -p 8443:443 \
     -e DEBUG=1 \
     zerotier-proxy:dev
   ```

2. **Monitor logs during development**:
   ```bash
   docker logs -f zerotier-proxy-dev
   ```

### Testing Changes

Before submitting changes, please test:

1. **Build Test**: Ensure the Docker image builds successfully
2. **Functionality Test**: Verify the TCP proxy starts and accepts connections
3. **Port Test**: Confirm the proxy listens on the expected port
4. **Resource Test**: Check memory and CPU usage are reasonable
5. **Integration Test**: Test with actual ZeroTier clients if possible

## Development Guidelines

### Docker and Infrastructure Standards

- **Multi-stage builds**: Use multi-stage Dockerfiles for smaller final images
- **Security**: Run containers as non-root users when possible
- **Efficiency**: Minimize layers and use appropriate base images
- **Documentation**: Comment complex Dockerfile instructions
- **Testing**: Ensure images work across different architectures

### Commit Messages

We follow conventional commit format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(proxy): add support for custom TCP port configuration
fix(docker): resolve container startup issues on ARM64
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/description` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/description` - Code refactoring

**Examples:**
- `feature/custom-port-support`
- `fix/container-startup-issue`
- `docs/update-configuration-guide`

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update Documentation**: Ensure any new features are documented
2. **Test Thoroughly**: All tests should pass and new functionality should be tested
3. **Update Changelog**: Add your changes to the CHANGELOG.md file
4. **Clean History**: Squash commits if necessary for a clean history
5. **Descriptive PR**: Write a clear pull request description

## Reporting Issues

### Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:

1. **Environment Information**:
   - Docker version
   - Host operating system
   - Container image version/tag
   - Hardware architecture (amd64, arm64, etc.)

2. **Problem Description**:
   - What you expected to happen
   - What actually happened
   - Steps to reproduce the issue

3. **Logs and Output**:
   - Container logs (`docker logs <container-name>`)
   - Error messages
   - Network configuration details

4. **Additional Context**:
   - ZeroTier network configuration
   - Firewall settings

### Feature Requests

For feature requests, please provide:
- **Problem Statement**: What problem does this solve?
- **Proposed Solution**: How should it work?
- **Use Case**: When would this be useful?
- **Alternatives**: What other solutions have you considered?

## Style Guidelines

### Dockerfile Style

- **Comments**: Use clear comments to explain complex operations
- **Ordering**: Group related commands and order them logically
- **Caching**: Structure commands to maximize Docker layer caching
- **Security**: Follow security best practices (non-root user, minimal packages)
- **Size**: Minimize final image size while maintaining functionality

**Example:**
```dockerfile
# Use specific version tags, not 'latest'
FROM alpine:3.18

# Install dependencies in a single layer
RUN apk add --no-cache \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    && rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*

# Create non-root user
RUN adduser -D -s /bin/sh proxyuser

# Copy application files
COPY --chown=proxyuser:proxyuser . /app

# Switch to non-root user
USER proxyuser

# Document the port
EXPOSE 443

# Use exec form for better signal handling
CMD ["./tcp-proxy"]
```

### Documentation Style

- **Clarity**: Write clear, concise documentation
- **Examples**: Include practical examples for all features
- **Structure**: Use consistent heading structure and formatting
- **Links**: Keep internal links up to date
- **Code Blocks**: Use appropriate syntax highlighting
